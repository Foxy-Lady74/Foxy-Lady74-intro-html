            <h3>Hair</h3>
            <p>My hair has changed a lot over the years! It's originally mouse but the gray grows ever stronger! In terms of texture, it was very fine, but is now much more wiry as the gray takes hold.</p>
            <h3>Eyes</h3>
            <p>My eyes are blue but when I am sad, they get more gray and when I am excited they become a deeper blue. I've no idea why, but I kind of like that they change. Like mood ring eyes!</p>
        <h2 id="Emotional">Emotional identity</h2>
        <p>Emotionally, I am a bit of a roller-coaster, but like an iceburg, the biggest part is hidden from view, so most of the time you won't know the extent of it! I am a cryer, and feel things deeply. Silly things like adverts can set me off. I work hard to keep myself steady by focussing on my wellbeing, and using the following tactics.</p> 
        <ol>
            <li>taking walks in the forest</li>
            <li>choosing foods wisely</li>
            <li>drinking lots of water</li>
            <li>prioritising my peace of mind when possible</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="Family">Family</h2>
            <p>My family is quite widespread now, and live in various locations across the UK. My parents divorced when I was very small, and my Mum has since also divorced my step-Dad, who has remarried and is still my Dad in every sense of the word! My immediate family members are:</p>
